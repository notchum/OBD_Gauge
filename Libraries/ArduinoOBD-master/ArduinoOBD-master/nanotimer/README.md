This sketch works like a Performance Box with the Arduino Nano based [Freematics Nano Kit](https://freematics.com/products/arduino-telematics-kit-1/). It displays live vehicle speed (data from OBD-II) and the time used for reaching speed of 60km/h, 100km/h, 200km/h and distance of 400m. Measurement is automatically started evey time when vehicle starts moving from stationary.
